# Water-Quality-Prediction
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a 
basic human right and a component of effective policy 
for health protection. This is important as a health 
and development issue at a national, regional, and 
local level. In some regions, it has been shown that 
investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a 
net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse 
health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs 
of undertaking the interventions. This classification 
project involves building a model to evaluate water 
potability using the following Water Quality dataset.
